            <p>Hello! My name is Caleb Beardall. I grew up in Kaysville, UT, served my mission in Tacoma, WA (2017-2019), and live in North Ogden UT. I've been married for 4 years and my wife's name is Drew; she's from Pinetop-Lakeside, AZ. I currently work for a fright brokerage as their claims manager which is a similar role to an insurance adjuster/underwriter. I've worked at said fright brokerage for about 5 years. While I've enjoyed my time there, I'm returning to school in hopes of finding more enjoyable employment opportunities in software development.</p>
